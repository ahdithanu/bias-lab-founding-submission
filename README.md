🎯 Bias Detection Methodology
5-Dimension Framework

Ideological Stance (0=left, 50=center, 100=right)
Factual Grounding (source quality, claim verification)
Framing Choices (what's emphasized vs. buried)
Emotional Tone (neutral vs. inflammatory language)
Source Transparency (attribution clarity)

Technical Implementation

Model: OpenAI GPT-3.5 with structured prompting
Processing: <500ms per article with rate limiting
Confidence: 0.1-1.0 based on analysis clarity
Explainability: Highlighted phrases justify each score


💡 Strategic Insights
Why This Approach Wins
Most submissions will be static mockups or theoretical frameworks. This demonstrates:

✅ Working system: Real bias detection you can test immediately
✅ Production thinking: Monitoring, scaling, error handling
✅ User experience: Real-time feedback with progress visualization
✅ Business strategy: Revenue model, market positioning, scaling plan
✅ Cross-functional skills: Both technical depth AND strategic thinking

Competitive Advantage

Real-time analysis beats batch processing
Explainable AI builds user trust through highlighted phrases
Narrative clustering reveals patterns humans miss
Operations-first design ensures scalability from day one
